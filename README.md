## Python Rutgers Bootcamp Challenge - Electric Vehicles In State of Washington

This activity is broken down into multiple deliverables to makes progress towards developing a full-stack data visualization web application that allows users to interactively explore a dataset.

## Description

In this assignment, we will need to complete the following objectives: 

Data and Delivery 

* Data components used in the project are clearly documented. 
* The dataset contains at least 100 unique records. 
* A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 
* The project is powered by a Python Flask API and includes HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and the chosen database
  
Back End 

* The page created to showcase data visualizations runs without error. (7.5 points)
* A JavaScript library not shown in class is used in the project. (7.5 points)

The project conforms to one of the following designs

* A Leaflet or Plotly chart built from data gathered through web scraping.
* A dashboard page with multiple charts that all reference the same data.
  
Visualizations 

* A minimum of three unique views present the data. 
* Multiple user-driven interactions (such as dropdowns, filters, or a zoom feature) are included on the final page. 
* The final page displays visualizations in a clear, digestable manner. 
* The data story is easy to interpret for users of all levels.
  
## Instructions

1. Identifying Data For Analysis

* Our group chose to select and analyze data based on  [Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2)

### Dependencies

* Using Visual Studio Code for coding and data visualizations
* Web browser to show data visualizations (Google Chrome used but coudl be Mozilla or another)
* Use index to initiate data visualization
* Use app file in static folder to understand code for application

### Installing

* No modifications needed to be made to files/folders

## Help

* Use console.log inside of your JavaScript code to see what your data looks like at each step.

* Refer to the Plotly.js documentationLinks to an external site. when building the plots.
